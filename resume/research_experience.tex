            \item {\textbf{\underline{Function and dynamics of the enzyme biotin carboxylase}}}
                \vspace{2pt}
                \begin{itemize}
                \item {Showed that the ATP binding domain of biotin carboxylase (BC) is most stable in a closed configuration for a monomer and most stable in an open configuration for a dimer explaining the loss of activity for monomers relative to dimers.}
                \item {Showed that there is communication between monomers of a BC dimer when ATP is bound in one monomer and that the most stable state is one with both monomers closed, supporting other evidence suggesting that a reaction occurs in only one monomer at a time.}
                \end{itemize}

                    \item {Showed that the required slit length is dependent on surface roughness and surface chemistry and that multiple surface types might be combined to reduce the required length.}

                \begin{itemize}
                \item {Showed that the most probable depth of the tocopherol chromanol group in DMPC, DPPC, POPC, and POPE bilayers is just below the lipid carbonyl groups.}
                \item {Analyzed trajectory data to show that the higher rates of flipping tocopherol between bilayer leaflets at higher concentrations in thinner bilayers such as DMPC is associated with tocopherol clusters that span the bilayer.}

                    \item {Simulations showed the same qualitative trends as experiments in lipid gel to fluid transition temperatures and lipid/water partition coefficients for three lignin dimer derivatives in lipid bilayers.}
                    \item {Simulations showed the same qualitative trends in β-cyclodextrin binding affinities as experiments for three lignin dimer derivatives.}
                    \item {Showed that some bonds for lignin in deep eutectic solvents are more susceptible to microwaves including the most common monomer linkage.}
                \end{itemize}

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Simulations of DMPC bilayers with and without added DMSO showed that DMSO increased the amount of water in the bilayer and rate of permeation through the bilayer, changed the lipid head group orientations and dyanmics, and modified the electrostatic potential profile across the bilayer.
                \end{itemize}
