            \item {I have more than 15 years of experience as a computational scientist. My work involved designing, parameterizing, and optimizing molecular simulation models to analyze and predict molecular behavior and properties. I have applied molecular simulations to various systems including biomolecular systems (proteins, DNA, lipid bilayers, and lignin), metals and alloys (rapid solidification, deposition of Cu on TiN, liquid properties), bubble nucleation, self-assembly, and coupling molecular dynamics and continuum models.}
            \item {My work on over 15 projects has resulted in the publication of 21 research papers. I have collaborated with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds including engineering, computer science, physics, and chemistry, including both computational scientists and experimentalists. I also served as a leader and mentor for multiple undergraduate and graduate students as they worked on their research projects.}
            \item {I possess strong skills in statistics, machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, and programming in Python, bash, MATLAB, SQL, and other languages.}
